**Version 1.0.0**

Project that stores videos in a database that can be rented by customers and managed by users using a RESTful API.

This project was created by me through the the codwithmosh nodeJS training program on codewithmosh.com.  The code here is only for viewing purposes.

### Quick explanation

* index.js is main file that routes the server to all the middleware and modules to handle the server requests
* startup folder contains the code required to start up the server such as connecting to the database, listening to a port, etc.
* routes folder contains the implementation for handling all the requests on each uri
* config folder contains the environment variable settings
* models folder contains the schema and validation requirement for each uri
* middleware folder contains all the middleware for the server
* tests contain the unit and integration tests for the code

### Running the program

1. use `start` to run the program
2. use `test` to run the unit and integration tests
